Certainly! Here's an example of how to create a documentation website using MkDocs to describe the .NET 7 project structure using Clean Architecture.

## Introduction

In this document, we'll explore the structure of a .NET 7 project following the Clean Architecture pattern. Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes separation of concerns and decoupling dependencies between different layers of an application. This helps to make code more modular, testable, and maintainable over time.

## Project Structure

The project structure for a .NET 7 application following Clean Architecture consists of four main layers:

1. Presentation Layer
2. Application Layer
3. Domain Layer
4. Infrastructure Layer

Each layer has its own responsibilities and dependencies, and they are arranged in a way that allows each layer to interact only with the layer directly below it.

### Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer is responsible for handling user input and output. It consists of user interface components such as controllers, views, and razor pages. These components should be thin and delegate most of their work to the Application Layer. In our structure, the Presentation Layer is at the top, closest to the user.

### Application Layer

The Application Layer contains the business logic of the application. It coordinates interactions between the Presentation Layer and the Domain Layer, and it is where you would implement use cases or services. The Application Layer should not rely on any lower-level implementation details, such as databases or external APIs. Instead, it depends on abstractions defined in the Domain Layer.

### Domain Layer

The Domain Layer represents the core business logic of the application. It contains entities, value objects, and business rules that define the behavior of the system. The Domain Layer should not depend on any infrastructure or application-specific details. Instead, it should define interfaces that the Application Layer can use to interact with it.

### Infrastructure Layer

The Infrastructure Layer provides implementations for the interfaces defined in the Domain Layer. It is where you would put code to interact with databases, external APIs, or other infrastructure components. The Infrastructure Layer depends on the Domain Layer but not on any higher-level layers such as the Application Layer or Presentation Layer.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are automated tests that test individual units of code in isolation. In a Clean Architecture project, unit tests should be written for each component in the Presentation, Application, and Domain Layers. These tests should not depend on any external resources such as databases or APIs, and they should run quickly and reliably.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are automated tests that test the interactions between different components in the system. In a Clean Architecture project, integration tests should be written for the interactions between the Application Layer and the Infrastructure Layer. These tests should ensure that the system as a whole behaves correctly, and they should be run less frequently than unit tests due to their longer execution time.

## Project Diagram

Here's a diagram of how the different layers fit together in our Clean Architecture structure:

```
+----------------+
| Presentation   |
+----------------+
|  Application   |
+----------------+
|    Domain      |
+----------------+
| Infrastructure |
+----------------+
|     Tests      |

        Rule2
    end
end

    subgraph Repositories
        Repository1
        Repository2
    end
    subgraph DataSources
        DataSource1
        DataSource2
    end
end

subgraph Tests
    subgraph UnitTests
        UnitTest1
        UnitTest2
    end
    subgraph IntegrationTests
        IntegrationTest1
        IntegrationTest2
    end
end

Presentation --> Application
Application --> Domain
Domain --> Infrastructure
Tests --> Application
Tests --> Domain
Tests --> Infrastructure
```

As you can see, each layer only knows about the layer directly below it and communicates through well-defined interfaces. This makes it easy to maintain and test each layer independently.

## Conclusion

By following the Clean Architecture pattern, we can create applications that are modular, testable, and maintainable over time. In this document, we explored the four main layers of a .NET 7 project using Clean Architecture and how they interact with each other. We also provided a diagram to help you visualize the structure of your own projects.

I hope this helps guide you as you develop your own .NET 7 projects using Clean Architecture!
